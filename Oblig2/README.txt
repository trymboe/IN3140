The oblig was slightly more difficult than the last one, but with the extended deadline it was doable. The most difficult part was tasks 2c, while the rest went over pretty easy. In the last couple of tasks I might have some wrong values caused by using a robot where the z-axis points the opposite direction than indicated in the task. I am not sure if this will alter the answers because both theta 2 and theta 3 se no movement in the z-axis. And also because i believe that the velocity i find i task 2 is in relation to the base coordinates which are correct.
