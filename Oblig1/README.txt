The assignment went well, and it was very interesting to use what we had learned in the lectures to actually derive the right values for the robot. The difficulty felt appropriate, and when I knew the tricks like the cosine rule and atan2, the inverse kinematics went well. It was quite difficult to keep track of all the cos and sin in the matrix from task 3. 

Something I could have done better is to write the task in english. It did not cross my mind until I had wrote too much to rewrite. I heard from a group session that the examiner is Norwegian, so I thought it would be fine.
